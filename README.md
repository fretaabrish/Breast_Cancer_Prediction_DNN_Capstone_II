# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_DNN_Capstone_II

In order to detect breast cancer, radiologists conduct Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) procedure of breast tumor. Hence, development of algorithms which rely on digitized image analysis, is of great interest. The key objective of this project was to predict breast cancer as benign or malignant using data set from the digitized image of FNA sample. 
The data set was acquired from the Kaggle Competition. We explored the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set to classify the diagnosis of a digitized image of FNA of a breast mass to benign or malignant. The proportion of Benign to malignant tumors was 62.7% and 37.3% respectively. After doing exploratory data analysis, and pre-processing we applied deep neural network using TensorFlow version of Keras to train on 80%, validate on 10% and test on the remaining 10% of the dataset.  Finally, we got an outstanding model with AUC score of 0.9967, and accuracy of 0.9825.
